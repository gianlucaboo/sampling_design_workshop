## Workshop

#### Rationale and Objectives

::: incremental
-   Strengthen **geospatial and sampling** capacity of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
-   Introduce AI-assisted sampling to **improve efficiency, representativeness, and inclusivity**.
-   Align **methods with Government priorities** and international standards for comparability.
-   Enhance **policy relevance of PDHS data** and enable cross-country analysis.
:::

## Workshop

#### Topics

::: incremental
-   Foundations of **survey sampling** theory and practice.
-   **Geospatial data** processing and updating census/sampling frames.
-   Use of **Earth Observation (EO)** data for spatial stratification.
-   Application of **AI/ML methods** (clustering, prediction) in sample design.
-   **Simulation and optimization** of sampling strategies using R.
-   Development of R Shiny applications to **evaluate and visualize sampling designs**.
-   Hands-on practice with **survey analysis software** and calibration techniques.
-   Addressing **cost-effectiveness and nonresponse** adjustments in survey design.

## Workshop

#### Expected Outcomes

::: incremental
-   Enhanced PBS ability to **design robust, adaptive, and cost-effective samples**.
-   Practical **skills in R, GIS, EO data, and AI/ML tools**.
-   Prototype **interactive tools (Shiny apps) for survey design evaluation**.
-   Improved readiness to implement the upcoming PDHS with **modern, AI-driven approaches**.
